; READ ME: This B3GET extension contains all functions related to output results. Data collection 
; can be turned ON or OFF with the OUTPUT-RESULTS? switch on the user interface. When ON is selected, 
; the OUTPUT-RESULTS function is applied once every timestep. Agent state variables are accessible 
; during data collection to record complete agent histories. This extension uses the IMPORT-EXPORT
; extension to record data at the simulation, group, or individual level and the VERIFICATION
; extension to run code verification checks. Modify the USER SETTINGS below for specific data
; collection preferences.

; DETERMINE GENETIC RELATEDNESS BETWEEN TWO INDIVIDUALS
;
; This routine determines the genetic relatedness between the caller and a
; specified individual in the population. For example, consider these four
; chromosomes.
;
; Locus         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
;
; Caller:   I:  y h m u n f q a x r

;
; Target:   I:  j l h y m d u t v c
;          II:  y u l x i s f p w a
;
; The first locus has one match, Caller I and Target II, and three non-matches,
; Caller I and Target I (y and J), Caller II and Target I (c and j), and
; Caller II to Target II (c y). This is considered a relatedness of
; <m>1/(1+3) = 0.25</m>, at the first locus. This is repeated across all loci
; and the average is returned.
;
; ENTRY:  'target' defines an individual to be compared the calling individual.
;         'identity.I' and 'identity.II' carry the genetic information to be
;          compared between caller and target.
;         'identity.I' and 'identity.II' both contain exactly 10 loci.
;
; EXIT:   'relatedness-with' returns an estimate of the degree of relatedness, as
;          fraction between 0 and 1.

;TRIAL FITTING OF KNOWN DATA
;
;This routine accepts a set of data containing observations and predictions, and
;computes how well the predictions match the observations. Various measures of
;how well they match can be calculated in this routine, such as with
;least-squares, least absolute value, or other measures. The goodness of fit is
;presented in the form of
;<m>R^2</m>.<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination/> That
;is, it is presented as <m>1-F/E</m>, where <m>F</m> is the summed deviations of
;the observations from the predictions, and <m>E</m> is summed deviations of the
;observations from the expected value (mean) of the observations if there were no
;functional relationship.
;
;ENTRY: The actual and predicted observations appear on the standard input file.
;       The first two columns are the actual moose and wolf observed populations,
;         the last two columns are the predicted moose and wolf populations.
;
;EXIT:  The standard output file contains a record of the input and the
;         calculated goodness of fit.
