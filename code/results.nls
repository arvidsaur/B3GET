; READ ME: This B3GET extension contains all functions related to output results. Data collection 
; can be turned ON or OFF with the OUTPUT-RESULTS? switch on the user interface. When ON is selected, 
; the OUTPUT-RESULTS function is applied once every timestep. Agent state variables are accessible 
; during data collection to record complete agent histories. This extension uses the IMPORT-EXPORT
; extension to record data at the simulation, group, or individual level and the VERIFICATION
; extension to run code verification checks. Modify the USER SETTINGS below for specific data
; collection preferences.
